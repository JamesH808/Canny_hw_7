After debugging I realized I hadn't set the channel size to a reasonable amount so only 1 frame was being processed at a time.
It also took me a while to figure out the time difference to calculate the fps but I realized I had to set last time to 
current time after printing everything out. 

Gaussian smooth:
        -gaussian kernel: <.1%
        -Blurx: 12.46%
        -Blury: 25.74%
derivx_y: 13.45%
magx_y: 4.57%
non_max: 26.40%
apply_hyst: 17.33%

from the last assignment we can see in this assignment that a lot of frames are sent to the monitor before it can process a 
single frame through the delay and fps measurements.
